Little faith, follow me
I set a fire in a blackberry field
Make us laugh, or nothing will
I set a fire just to see what it kills

Now I'm stuck in New York
And the rain's coming down
I don't feel like we'll go anywhere
Stuck in New York
And the rain's coming down
Still in line for the vanity fair

Leave our red Southern souls
Head for the coast
Leave our red Southern souls
Everything goes

All our lonely kicks are getting harder to find
We'll play nuns versus priests until somebody cries
All our lonely kicks that make us saintly and thin
We'll play nuns versus priests until somebody wins
