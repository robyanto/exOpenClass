Little faith, follow me
I set a fire in a blackberry field
Make us laugh, or nothing will
I set a fire just to see what it kills

Now I'm stuck in New York
And the rain's coming down
I don't feel like we'll go anywhere
Stuck in New York
And the rain's coming down
Still in line for the vanity fair

Leave our red Southern souls
Head for the coast
Leave our red Southern souls
Everything goes
