When I think of you in the city,
The sight of you among the sites.
I get this sudden sinking feeling,
Of a man about to fly.
Never kept me up before,
Now I've been awake for days.
I can't fight it anymore,
I'm going through an awkward phase.
I am secretly in love with,
Everyone that I grew up with.
Do my crying underwater,
I can't get down any farther.
All my drowning friends can see,
Now there is no running from it.
It's become the crux of me,
I wish that I could rise above it.
